# media-2.0

This project will combine the functionallity of the media server and client into a single application and refactor the front end to utilize react.

The server will also be refactored to use Mongodb instead of postgresql.


npm install
npm start
localhost:8080

Mongo DB setup :
Create DB named Movie.  'use movie'
Create and save first item in collection named "movies" with model of '{ movie_id : 1 }'
Npm install mongoose in repository to run index.js
